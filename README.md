<h1>VIRTUAL MOUSE</h1>
<p>The Virtual Mouse using Python is an innovative application that allows users to control the computer cursor and perform mouse operations through simple hand gestures, without the need for physical hardware. 
This project combines computer vision, artificial intelligence, and automation to create a gesture-based human–computer interaction (HCI) system.</p>


<p>Using OpenCV for image processing, Mediapipe for hand landmark detection, and PyAutoGUI along with Pynput for system-level mouse actions, 
the program recognizes real-time hand movements through the webcam and converts them into cursor movement and click commands.
Specific gestures trigger different actions such as left click, right click, double click, cursor movement, and even automatic screenshots.</p>
